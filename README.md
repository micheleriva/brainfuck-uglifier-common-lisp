# ðŸ’© Brainfuck Uglifier - WIP

A Brainfuck optimizer which removes useless spaces, comments and useless characters from your Brainfuck program.

I know this is pretty useless, but I am trying some new programming languages and this is a really simple task to replicate across all the programming languages that I am currently testing.

**Other Languages:** <br />
- [GoLang](https://github.com/micheleriva/brainfuck-uglifier-go)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/micheleriva/brainfuck-uglifier-ruby)

**Work in progress:**
- [Common Lisp](https://github.com/micheleriva/brainfuck-uglifier-common-lisp)
